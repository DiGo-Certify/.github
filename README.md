# Hey, this is SCAR 👋

**SCAR**, **S**mart **C**ontract **A**cademic **Registry** is a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) approach to [academic certificates verification](https://link-to-the-future-article). It is focused on the development of a decentralized application that allows the verification of academic certificates by a third party in a secure and transparent way. The project is developed using the **Ethereum** blockchain.

We are a group of two students from the [University ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/en/), [Diogo Rodrigues](https://github.com/Diogofmr/) and [Gonçalo Frutuoso](https://github.com/Gongamax/),
and we are developing this project as part of our final project for the [Computer Engineering](https://www.isel.pt/en/courses/computer-engineering) course.
As part of the project, we are developing an article that will be published in the future at [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/) journal.
